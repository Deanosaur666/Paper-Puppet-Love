Offset during animations (for moving)

Offset should push the pushbox forwards, as well

Draw the "center point" and "offset point" of a pose.

Shake during hit freeze

How should cancels work?
    Cancel rules are on a per-attack basis..?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Attacks CSV
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Attacks have "stances" which will be a semicolon-seperated list of names
We translate character-specific stances to unique numerical flags 
"HURT" "GUARD" "RECOVERY" etc will be in the same spot in the CSV, but when parsing we will interpret them as non-stance state flags
ReqStance in CSV will be a list we will convert into a "required state flags" bit-number thingy

"Copy attack" will be used to copy data first from another attack, and then we will over-write with any unqiue data if necessary.
(Used for different variant characters sharing data)

Add basic "startup step" movement

Canceling based on "Attack Class"
    Light,
    Medium,
    Heavy,
    SuperHeavy,

Currently the system is "reqStateFlags" 

A "follow-up" is a special case, where regardless of move class, it will cancel from its previous attack.

"Delayed" controller for online play
    In MojoFighter, we basically just add our inputs a few frames "into the future"

Duplicate Animations

Highlight parts in selection so it's easier to see what part is selected.

-Lock lower leg and lower arm position/rotation to avoid accidents
-Setting the idle pose, default to that pose rather than "0-pose"
-Context menus for posing on right-click?
-Change between hitball mode, sprite change mode, or pose mode in posing (Maybe as "tools" like in blender?)
-Hotkeys to change sprite sheet in blueprint and animation editors (So you don't need to return to sprite editor)
-Button or key to discard all changes and reload (without exiting and re-opening)


Labeling hitballs for gameplay purposes (may be useful if you want a projectile to spawn from a specific hitball, or want a weak spot)
Labeling specific frames? (we probably want to know if a frame is considered active, recovery?, or is a charge frame?)

Animation editor
    Move a frame in the timeline maybe

    Copy animation
    Copy animation with just starting frame (attack from idle, for example)

    Filter or sort animations








--------JIMBO Notes/Complaints------------

I don't like the way cancel flags are arbitrary. Some moves COULD cancel on contact, and some might not.

State flags? Do they need to be in state? Or in fframe?
