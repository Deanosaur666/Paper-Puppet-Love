Gut out reqStateFlags

Offset during animations (for moving)
    How do we make sure it is the same between frames?
Offset should push the pushbox forwards, as well
    -Kit's far kick especially needs this....

Draw the "center point" and "offset point" of a pose.

How should cancels work?
    Cancel rules are on a per-attack basis..?

Canceling based on "Attack Class"
    Light,
    Medium,
    Heavy,
    SuperHeavy,

Currently the system is "reqStateFlags" 

A "follow-up" is a special case, where regardless of move class, it will cancel from its previous attack.

"Delayed" controller for online play
    In MojoFighter, we basically just add our inputs a few frames "into the future"

Duplicate Animations

Highlight parts in selection so it's easier to see what part is selected.

-Lock lower leg and lower arm position/rotation to avoid accidents
-Setting the idle pose, default to that pose rather than "0-pose"
-Context menus for posing on right-click?
-Change between hitball mode, sprite change mode, or pose mode in posing (Maybe as "tools" like in blender?)
-Hotkeys to change sprite sheet in blueprint and animation editors (So you don't need to return to sprite editor)
-Button or key to discard all changes and reload (without exiting and re-opening)


Labeling hitballs for gameplay purposes (may be useful if you want a projectile to spawn from a specific hitball, or want a weak spot)
Labeling specific frames? (we probably want to know if a frame is considered active, recovery?, or is a charge frame?)

Animation editor
    Move a frame in the timeline maybe

    Copy animation
    Copy animation with just starting frame (attack from idle, for example)

    Filter or sort animations

I don't like the way cancel flags are arbitrary. Some moves COULD cancel on contact, and some might not.

State flags? Do they need to be in state? Or in fframe?
