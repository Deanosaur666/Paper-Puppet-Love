Screens:

Onion skinning

Animation editor GUI:
Left is animation list
Bottom is animation timeline (width of frames based on length)

Fix gui issues in screens 2 and 3 based on swapping offset and scale order

Skeletons have animations... so we need to edit them

Animation Editor

Sort part update order based on parenting, rather than manually ordered...
    Parts with no parents first,
    Then, parts parented to that part,
    Etc...

Labeling hitballs for gameplay purposes (may be useful if you want a projectile to spawn from a specific hitball, or want a weak spot)

Maybe shift+click to swap parts?

Animation editor
    Create an animation with a name
    Create a frame for an animation
    Copy a frame
    Set a frame's duration
    Move a frame in the timeline maybe
