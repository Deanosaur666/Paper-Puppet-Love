Jimbo says:
-Copy Global Coordinates for feet positions
--(We may need an "apply global position" function that also updates IK and stuff)
-Save if a part defaults to IK lock and IK alt 
-Lock lower leg and lower arm position/rotation to avoid accidents
-Setting the idle pose, default to that pose rather than "0-pose"
-Context menus for posing on right-click?
-Change between hitball mode, sprite change mode, or pose mode in posing (Maybe as "tools" like in blender?)
-Hotkeys to change sprite sheet in blueprint and animation editors (So you don't need to return to sprite editor)
-Button or key to discard all changes and reload (without exiting and re-opening)

-Undo functionality of some sort for the animation editor could be useful, because that is where the most "mistakes" occur

"Extend Scale" which is a seperate scaling value which visually scales based on a ratio when extending an IK part

Screens:



Still have JSON issues actually :(

Sort part update order based on parenting, rather than manually ordered...
    Parts with no parents first,
    Then, parts parented to that part,
    Etc...

Labeling hitballs for gameplay purposes (may be useful if you want a projectile to spawn from a specific hitball, or want a weak spot)
Labeling specific frames? (we probably want to know if a frame is considered active, recovery?, or is a charge frame?)

Maybe shift+click to swap parts?

Animation editor
    Move a frame in the timeline maybe

    Copy animation
    Copy animation with just starting frame (attack from idle, for example)

    Buttons:
        Cut frame
