Still have JSON issues actually :(

Sort part update order based on parenting, rather than manually ordered...
    Parts with no parents first,
    Then, parts parented to that part,
    Etc...

Labeling hitballs for gameplay purposes (may be useful if you want a projectile to spawn from a specific hitball, or want a weak spot)
Labeling specific frames? (we probably want to know if a frame is considered active, recovery?, or is a charge frame?)

Maybe shift+click to swap parts?

Animation editor
    Move a frame in the timeline maybe

    Copy animation
    Copy animation with just starting frame (attack from idle, for example)

    Buttons:
        Cut frame
