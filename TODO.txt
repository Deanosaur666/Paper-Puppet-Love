IKDrag does not work on parts with flipped xscale, yscale!

Hitballflags and stuff cause JSON errors!!!!

Sort part update order based on parenting, rather than manually ordered...
    Parts with no parents first,
    Then, parts parented to that part,
    Etc...

Labeling hitballs for gameplay purposes (may be useful if you want a projectile to spawn from a specific hitball, or want a weak spot)

Maybe shift+click to swap parts?
