Ctrl + scroll in skeleton view to zoom in and out (when not over a part)

Zooming and scrolling screens if parts get too big

Hiding/unhiding parts in frames (could be useful for weapons and stuff)
Show partframe layers when holding L
Labeling hitballs for gameplay purposes (may be useful if you want a projectile to spawn from a specific hitball, or want a weak spot)

Better scaling controls

Maybe shift+click to swap parts?
