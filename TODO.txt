Jimbo says:

-Lock lower leg and lower arm position/rotation to avoid accidents
-Setting the idle pose, default to that pose rather than "0-pose"
-Context menus for posing on right-click?
-Change between hitball mode, sprite change mode, or pose mode in posing (Maybe as "tools" like in blender?)
-Hotkeys to change sprite sheet in blueprint and animation editors (So you don't need to return to sprite editor)
-Button or key to discard all changes and reload (without exiting and re-opening)


Labeling hitballs for gameplay purposes (may be useful if you want a projectile to spawn from a specific hitball, or want a weak spot)
Labeling specific frames? (we probably want to know if a frame is considered active, recovery?, or is a charge frame?)

Animation editor
    Move a frame in the timeline maybe

    Copy animation
    Copy animation with just starting frame (attack from idle, for example)

    Filter or sort animations
